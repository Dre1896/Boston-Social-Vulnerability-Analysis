# Social Vulnerability Analysis
<div align="center">
  <p align="justify">
This project leverages public data from the "Climate Ready Boston Social Vulnerability" dataset available on data.boston.gov to analyze and visualize the distribution of vulnerable populations across different neighborhoods in Boston. The goal is to identify areas with higher concentrations of socially vulnerable groups, such as disabled individuals and children, and to utilize this data to plan interventions that enhance urban resilience and inclusivity.
